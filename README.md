Extract Mirth CodeTemplates

Drop in directory with Mirth extracted XML files and execute to create "extracted-mirth-javascript" directory.
Zip up resulting directory to scan with Veracode Static Analysis.

Please note Veracode Static Analysis does not currently support Mirth Connect / Next Gen Connect, without explicit support analysis will be severely limited. 
I recommend performing other analysis on this such as Manual Penetration Testing.
